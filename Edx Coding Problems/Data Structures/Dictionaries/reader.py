#Recall in coding problem 4.4.3 that you wrote a function
#called "reader" that read a .cs1301 file and returned a
#list of lists.
#
#Let's revise that problem. Instead of a list of lists,
#that's return a dictionary of dictionaries.
#
#Write a function called "reader" that takes one parameter,
#a filename as a string corresponding to a .cs1301 file,
#and reads in that .cs1301 file.
#
#Each line of the .cs1301 file will have five items, each
#separated by a space: the first, third, and fourth will
#represent integers, the second will be a string, and the
#fifth will represent a float. (Note: when reading the
#file, these will all be strings; you can assume each of
#these strings can be converted to the corresponding data
#type, however.)
#
#The function should return a dictionary of dictionaries
#representing the file contents.
#
#The keys of the top-level dictionary should be the
#assignment names. Then, the value for each of those keys
#should be a dictionary with four keys: "number", "grade",
#"total", and "weight". The values corresponding to each of
#those four keys should be the values from the file,
#converted to the corresponding data types (ints or floats).
#
#For example, if the input file read:
#
# 1 exam_1 90 100 0.6
# 2 exam_2 95 100 0.4
#
#Then reader would return this dictionary of dictionaries:
#
# {"exam_1": {"number": 1, "grade": 90, "total": 100, "weight": 0.6},
#  "exam_2": {"number": 2, "grade": 95, "total": 100, "weight": 0.4}}
#
#Hint: Although the end result is pretty different, this
#should only dictate a minor change to your original
#Problem 4.4.3 code!


#Write your function here!
def reader(file_input):
    contents = open(file_input, "r")
    listy = contents.readlines()
    return_dictionary ={}
    # print(listy)
    listy2 = [each_character.replace("\n","") for each_character in listy]
    # print(listy2)
    for each_line in listy2:
        mini_dict ={}
        # print(each_line)
        # print(type(each_line))
        listy3 = each_line.split()
        # print(listy3)
        total = int(listy3[3])
        number = int(listy3[0])
        grade = int(listy3[2])
        weight = float(listy3[4])
        # print(total)
        # print(type(total))
        mini_dict["total"] = total

        mini_dict["number"] = number
        mini_dict["grade"] = grade
        mini_dict["weight"] = weight
        return_dictionary[listy3[1]] = mini_dict
    return return_dictionary
        # pass


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print (although the order of the keys may vary):
#{'assignment_1': {'total': 100, 'number': 1, 'grade': 85, 'weight': 0.25}, 'test_1': {'total': 100, 'number': 2, 'grade': 90, 'weight': 0.25}, 'exam_1': {'total': 100, 'number': 3, 'grade': 95, 'weight': 0.5}}

# sample answer

def reader(filename):

    #First, as we did last chapter, we open the file
    #and set it equal to a variable:

    file_reader = open(filename)

    #Next, we're going to want to create a dictionary, so
    #let's create an empty dictionary for our results:

    results = {}

    #Now we want to iterate through each line of the file:

    for line in file_reader:

        #For each line, we want to split it by the spaces
        #to get a tuple with five elements:

        parts = line.split(" ")

        #Remember, the directions said we can assume the
        #file is correctly-formed. So, we don't have to
        #worry about checking if there are five items or
        #if they can be converted to the right types.
        #
        #So, now we can unpack parts into more intuitive,
        #readable variable names:

        number, name, grade, total, weight = parts

        #Now, we can create a new dictionary specifically
        #for this line. This dictionary should have four
        #keys: number, grade, total, and weight. Notice
        #that we chose the variable names on line 30
        #specifically to make this easier to write:

        new_dict = {"number": int(number), "grade": int(grade), "total": int(total), "weight": float(weight)}

        #Now for the tricky thing. This dictionary,
        #new_dict, should be the *value* in our big results
        #dictionary. The key should be the assignment name.
        #
        #So, we add this dictionary as the value to results,
        #with name as its key:

        results[name] = new_dict

        #And we're done! Notice that we could have compressed
        #the last three lines down to one line, shown here:
        #
        #results[parts[1]] = {"number":int(parts[0]), "grade":int(parts[2]), "total":int(parts[3]), "weight":float(parts[4])}

    #Finally, after the loop is done, we must remember to close
    #the file:

    file_reader.close()

    #And then return the dictionary we created:

    return results



print(reader("sample.cs1301"))

# In order traversal of a Binary Tree

Inorder traversal is one of the Depth-First Traversal (DFS) techniques used for binary trees. It follows a specific order:

**Left Subtree** → Visit all nodes in the left subtree.  
**Root Node** → Process the current node.
**Right Subtree** → Visit all nodes in the right subtree.

This traversal is commonly used for binary search trees (BSTs) because it visits nodes in ascending order.

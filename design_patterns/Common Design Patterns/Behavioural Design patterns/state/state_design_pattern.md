# State Design Pattern

The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It helps implement state-dependent behavior while maintaining a clean and maintainable code structure.

## Key Concepts

**Context**: The main object that holds a reference to the current state.  
**State Interface**: Defines common behavior for all possible states.  
**Concrete States**: Different implementations of the state interface, representing various behaviors.  

## When to Use

When an object's: behavior depends on its state.  
When you have multiple if-else or switch statements controlling behavior based on state.  
When you need to encapsulate state-specific logic separately.  

## Real-World Analogy

The buttons and switches in your smartphone behave differently depending on the current state of the device:

When the phone is unlocked, pressing buttons leads to executing various functions.  
When the phone is locked, pressing any button leads to the unlock screen.  
When the phoneâ€™s charge is low, pressing any button shows the charging screen.

## Example

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# State Interface
class TrafficLightState(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def handle(self, traffic_light):
        pass

# Concrete States
class RedLight(TrafficLightState):
    def handle(self, traffic_light):
        print("Red Light - Stop")
        traffic_light.state = GreenLight()  # Transition to Green

class GreenLight(TrafficLightState):
    def handle(self, traffic_light):
        print("Green Light - Go")
        traffic_light.state = YellowLight()  # Transition to Yellow

class YellowLight(TrafficLightState):
    def handle(self, traffic_light):
        print("Yellow Light - Slow Down")
        traffic_light.state = RedLight()  # Transition to Red

# Context
class TrafficLight:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = RedLight()  # Initial State

    def change(self):
        self.state.handle(self)  # Delegate behavior to the state

# Usage
traffic_light = TrafficLight()

for _ in range(6):
    traffic_light.change()

```
